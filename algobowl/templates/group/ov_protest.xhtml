      <h1>Submit Open Verification Protest</h1>
      <p>
        You are about to submit a protest on a verification. If your protest
        is correct, the verification will change to the instructor's
        verification without causing you any penalty. If your protest is
        incorrect, it will cause your group one penalty point.
